     <h4>Steps:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
         Create a login index view
       </li>
       <li>
         Create .js file for ajaxing the controller
       </li>
       <li>
         Create a controller 
       </li>
     </ul>

      <p>
      1. Create login controller: in the controller there will be 2 parts: first
      part is to render login page/view; second part is to validate user name
      and password after login button submitted, if validate successfull >
      username and encrypted password will be reply to be session key and values <br/>
      2. Create a login view folder: in login.marko, will be a form for input
      user name and password, in lib.js will ajax validate function from login
      controller, and get username and encrypted password. Also assign the key
      to window name to use in multiple pages. The page then will redirected to
      whichever page it suppose to get to by using the last url after login word. <br/>
      3. After editing the page or adding new page, the session key and value
      will be validated again using sessionValidateion in lib folder. The reason
      for revalidate the key and value again because user can go straight to the
      editing page with the right url, but with out the key, the post will not
      be edited.
