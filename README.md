I am working on a new app to replace this app.
As of Oct 28, 2023 - there are many security vulnerability in npm packages.
I have fixed some of them by: do "npm install" then it will tell me what to fix, after fixing I can push it back to github.
So far, I have only done this for dev branch because after all the fixing, I can't get the app to run locally, yet.
Even before fixing, the app was not running locally because the node version was so old.
